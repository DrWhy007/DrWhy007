👋 Hi, I’m Abbas E 👨‍💻

I'm a trilingual (FR | EN | AR) professional who transitioned from leading business teams and managing financial strategies to building data-driven solutions. With a strong background in management and a growing technical skill set, I'm passionate about leveraging Big Data 🐘, Cloud ☁️, and AI 🤖 to solve real-world problems.

🔁 I recently completed an AEC in Big Data Development and am currently pursuing both an AEC in Artificial Intelligence and a Graduate Diploma (D.E.S.S.) in Project Management at HEC Montréal.

🚀 What I Do Now
====================

💡 I build robust data pipelines, automate workflows, and experiment with innovative ML models.
💻 I share tutorials and hands-on projects through my platform: BigDataNest.com. You can also find the code for some of my projects in my GitHub repositories (replace with your actual username).
📈 I love exploring how data engineering connects with business growth and strategic decision-making.
